This plugin provides:

* possibility to store geographical coordinates for members (latitude and
  longitude),
* a public map displaying up to date members that have chosen to be publicly
  visible.

## Installation

Laden Sie zunächst das Plugin herunter:

* [Get latest Maps
  plugin!](https://github.com/galette-plugins/plugin-maps/releases/latest)
* [Get Maps plugin nightly
  build!](https://github.com/galette-plugins/plugin-maps/releases/tag/nightly)

Extrahieren Sie das heruntergeladene Archiv im Verzeichnis Galette `plugins`.
Zum Beispiel unter Linux (Ersetzen Sie `{url}` und `{version}` durch korrekte
Werte):

```bash
$ cd /var/www/html/galette/plugins
$ wget {url}
$ tar xjvf galette-plugin-maps-{version}.tar.bz2
```

## Datenbank Initialisierung

Um zu funktionieren, benötigt dieses Plugin mehrere Tabellen in der Datenbank.
Siehe [Galette Plugins
Management-Schnittstelle](https://doc.galette.eu/en/master/plugins/index.html#plugins-managment).

And this is finished; Maps plugin is installed :)

## Background map

> The provider setting appeared in version 2.3.0. {: .admonition
> .admonition-note}

The provider is a setting from `Maps settings`, in the `Configuration` menu.

![The provider setting, in Maps settings](images/tiles_settings.png)

Several providers are proposed:

* **OpenFreeMap, light grey** — the default. Vector tiles, in a discreet grey
  that lets member markers stand out. No account, no API key, and the service
  can be [self-hosted](https://openfreemap.org).
* **OpenFreeMap, colours** — the same service, rendered in full colour.
* **OpenStreetMap** — the standard rendering, from the OpenStreetMap Foundation
  servers.
* **OpenStreetMap France** and **Humanitarian OSM Team** — hosted by the OSM-FR
  association; the second one gives more weight to roads and facilities.
* **OpenStreetMap Germany** — German rendering, favouring local names.
* **Esri, light grey** — a very light grey rendering, close to what the plugin
  displayed before.

### Your own values

> Warning {: .admonition-title}
> 
> Check the usage policy of the provider you choose. Most of them are run by
> associations or by volunteers, and they set conditions on the traffic they
> accept. {: .admonition .admonition-warning}

The last entry of the list, `Your own values`, replaces the proposed providers
with an address of your own — a provider that is not listed, or your own tile
server.

* **Vector tiles** tells the plugin what it is being given: a MapLibre style
  when ticked, classic raster tiles when not.
* **Address** is the style address for vector tiles, and the tiles address for
  raster ones, such as `https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`.
* **Attribution** is the credit the provider requires. HTML is allowed. It is
  not a formality: data licences make it mandatory.
* **Maximum zoom** is the deepest zoom level the provider serves. Going past it
  displays empty tiles.
* **Subdomains** lists the letters the `{s}` token of the address is replaced
  with, for instance `abc`. Raster tiles only.

## Plugin usage

When the plugin is installed, a group `Maps` is added to Galette menu when a
member is logged in, which contains `My location` entry. This page allow member
to store its location.

A `Geolocalize` button is also added when displaying a member, that allows
administrators to set member coordinates.

Also, a `Map` entry is added in public pages list, that displays geolocalized
members that are up to date. Administrators and staff members will see all
members, while simple members and visitors will only see up to date public ones.

First of all, members will enter their location coordinates. Several options are
provided:

* if town has been set in member information, a list of possible places will be
  proposed (via [Nominatim online
  service](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org)),
* additionally, a search zone (provided from
  [OpenStreetMap](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/)),
* and also a geolocalize button using browser capacities.

The search zone can be used when saving members location, and when displaying
the maps.

A member can define its location (with the precision he wants) on the map
selecting one of the propositions:

Using the geolocalization button will define its position from the browser:

Then, member location is displayed on map, and can be removed:
