title: Galette Maps
description: Member geolocation and public map
---

A [Galette](https://galette.eu) plugin to geolocalize members: it stores
geographical coordinates for each member, and displays the ones who agreed to be
publicly visible on a map.

Maps are rendered with [MapLibre GL](https://maplibre.org/) from
[OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/) vector tiles by default — no API key, no
registration, and the whole thing can be self-hosted. An administrator picks
another provider, or enters their own address, from Configuration. Search is
provided by the [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) API.

To use it you need a recent enough Galette — the required version is shown at the
top of this page — and the plugin itself, either by:

* downloading it with the buttons at the top of this page,
* or using the [source code from the repository](https://github.com/galette-plugins/plugin-maps),
  which requires some technical skills.

See the [documentation](documentation.html) for the installation steps.
